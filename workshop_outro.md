# Workshop Outro

* Tie all of the lessons together.
* Emphasize that the only way for attendees to really add the 
skills covered to their analytical "toolbag", they will need to
practice using them on their own data, and working through errors
independently.
* Remind to take the post-course survey linked from course website.

### Smithsonian Carpentries Website

This is the Carpentries webpage (graciously hosted on the SI Data Science Lab website). You can read about our mission, see who is on our Instructor Team and see links to past workshops.

### Direct email

We have a general resource email address for Carpentries-related questions: [SI-DataScience@si.edu](mailto:SI-DataScience@si.edu), or feel free to email any of the instructors or helpers directly.

### Carpentries-Announce Listserv

This is a 1-way announcement listserv where we will be announcing upcoming Carpentries (and other) workshops. Share this with your friends.

### Carpentries-Alumni Slack Channel

Slack is a message board/chat system.

1. Sign up for the Smithsonian Slack. If you already are a part of the Smithsonian Slack workspace, skip to Step #3. Go to [https://smithsonian.slack.com/signup](https://smithsonian.slack.com/signup), and enter your SI email account (must be @si.edu).
2. You will get an email from Slack, and click Confirm Email. This link will send you to a page where you will fill in your name, and set a password. After doing this, you will be logged into Slack and prompted to "Explore Slack". I recommend go through this tour if you are unfamiliar with the system.
3. You will automatically be "added" to the #general and #random "channels". These channels appear at the top of the list of all channels on the left side, and all others are greyed-out. Click on the greyed-out #carpentries-alumni, and then click the "Join Channel" button in the main window. If you do not see #carpentries-alumni as an option, click "+ Add a channel" below the list of channels. Search for carpentries-alumni, then click on the link to go to the channel. At the bottom of the screen, click the "Join Channel" button to join the channel.

### Carpentries Alumni Microsoft Team

Microsoft Teams is a chat and video call system, that is similar to Slack.

You can access the "Carpentries Alumni" Microsoft Team with this [direct link](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3aacffb6ba096b4fb0ad93595df6e89220%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=2e7c0abd-0ad8-4de0-bcf3-05af4b99aa38&tenantId=989b5e2a-14e4-4efe-93b7-8cdd5fc5d11c). The "Carpentries Alumni" team is set as a public team, so you should be able to access it via the Teams button on the left sidebar.

### Monthly Carpentries Brown Bag

The Carpentries Brown Bags are a series of monthly lunchtime gatherings for Smithsonian-affiliated staff, fellows, interns, contractors, etc. to discuss topics relating to Smithsonian Data or Software Carpentry workshop content.

We are hoping that these Brown Bags will enable us to continue the learning we started in our two-day workshops, while fostering a community of workshop "alumni" who can collaborate and support one another in our data and coding endeavors. (That said, if you are an SI-affiliated individual but you have not had a chance to participate in a workshop, you are still welcome to attend these Brown Bags!)

The Brown Bags will generally be held on the fourth Wednesday of every month from 1pm-2pm EST. On occasion, Brown Bags may be moved due to holidays; please check the detailed schedule for the exact dates.

Schedule: [https://github.com/SmithsonianWorkshops/carpentries-brown-bag/wiki/Schedule](https://github.com/SmithsonianWorkshops/carpentries-brown-bag/wiki/Schedule)

### Join the SI Carpentries Instructor Team

We are always looking for Smithsonian staff and fellows to be trained to join our team of instructors. No prior teaching experience is necessary, but "alumni" of the Carpentries workshops would make great candidates.
