SUBJECT: Thank you for attending [WORKSHOP NAME]

Thank you for participating in the Data Carpentry workshop last week. We hope you left the workshop feeling empowered to continue learning more about the tools that were covered. Like we tried to repeat several times during the workshop, you won't feel completely comfortable with any of the tools until you try them out on your own data, so I hope you have had a chance to put your new skills into practice since then. 
 
We would like to capture your thoughts about what was covered and your perception of the workshop overall. Please complete the post-workshop survey at [SURVEY LINK] as soon as possible.
 
If you go to the workshop GitHub repository [REPO LINK], you should see all of the materials from the lessons we covered. You will also see a Markdown document "keep_in_touch.md" that combines all of the various ways you can stay involved with the Carpentries community after the workshop.

[OPTIONAL CALL-OUT TO BROWNBAG]
We specifically wanted to remind you to mark your calendars for the next Carpentries Brown Bag that will be on [DATE] in the [ROOM]. [PRESENTER] will be giving a short demonstration on "[TOPIC]", and then we will have the rest of the hour to discuss data and the tools we use to clean and analyze data.
 
Thanks again for being such attentive learners, and feel free to email any of us about the tools you learned in the workshop, or about the Carpentries program in general.
 
Our best,
 
Your instructors:

* Instructor 1 (email)
* Instructor 2 (email)
